          CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation and layout of web pages. It works alongside HTML to define how elements should be displayed on different devices and screen sizes.

          Key Features of CSS:
          Separation of Content and Design: Enhances maintainability by keeping style separate from HTML.
          Selectors & Properties: Allows styling of specific elements using properties like color, font, margin, padding, etc.
          Responsive Design: Enables web pages to adapt to different screen sizes using media queries.
          Reusability: Styles can be applied to multiple pages, ensuring consistency across a website.
          Types of CSS:
          Inline CSS: Applied directly within an HTML element using the style attribute.
          Internal CSS: Defined within a <style> tag inside the <head> section of an HTML document.
          External CSS: Stored in a separate .css file and linked using <link> in HTML.
          CSS enhances user experience by making web pages visually appealing, structured, and accessible.
